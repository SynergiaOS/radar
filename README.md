# WIG30/WIG20 Profitability & Valuation Scanner Bot

A Python bot that analyzes the profitability and valuation of companies in the WIG30 and WIG20 indices using fundamental metrics from Yahoo Finance.

## Description

This bot automatically fetches financial data for companies in the WIG30 or WIG20 index (Poland's main stock market indices), calculates Return on Equity (ROE) and Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios, and applies dual filtering to identify fundamentally strong and undervalued companies. The bot filters companies based on positive net income, ROE ≥ 10% (profitability) AND P/E ≤ 15 (valuation), then displays a top 10 leaderboard sorted by ROE. Results are displayed in the console with comprehensive formatting showing ROE, P/E ratios, and exported to multiple CSV files for further analysis.

## Features

   - P/E ratio
   - Net income with thousand separators
   - Company name
4. Generate multiple CSV files in the same directory

### Generated Files
- `wig30_analysis_pe_threshold.csv` - Complete analysis of WIG30 companies meeting dual criteria

- `wig30_analysis_pe_threshold_all_profitable.csv` - All profitable companies (before P/E filtering)
- `wig20_analysis_pe_threshold.csv` - WIG20 version (when ACTIVE_INDEX = 'WIG20')
- `wig30_analysis.csv` - Legacy format for backward compatibility

### Example Output

## Configuration

### Modifying Settings
All configuration is centralized in `config.py`:

1. **Index Selection**: Set `ACTIVE_INDEX` to 'WIG30' or 'WIG20' to choose which index to analyze
2. **Update Ticker List**: Modify `WIG30_TICKERS` or `WIG20_TICKERS` to add/remove companies
3. **Adjust ROE Threshold**: Change `ROE_THRESHOLD` (default: 10.0) - minimum ROE percentage for filtering
4. **Set P/E Threshold**: Adjust `PE_THRESHOLD` (default: 15.0) - maximum P/E ratio for value investing filter
5. **Enable/Disable Dual Filtering**: Set `ENABLE_DUAL_FILTER` (default: True) to toggle simultaneous ROE and P/E filtering
6. **Control Display Count**: Modify `TOP_N_DISPLAY` (default: 10) to change how many top companies are shown
7. **Change Output Filename**: Update `OUTPUT_CSV_FILE` constant

**Example: To analyze only profitability without P/E filtering:**
```python
ENABLE_DUAL_FILTER = False  # Disable dual filtering
```

**Example: To change filtering criteria:**
```python
ROE_THRESHOLD = 15.0  # Only companies with ROE ≥ 15%
PE_THRESHOLD = 12.0  # More conservative valuation (P/E ≤ 12)
```

### Adding New Companies
To add companies to the analysis:
1. Open `config.py`
2. Add the ticker symbol to `WIG30_TICKERS` or `WIG20_TICKERS` list
3. Save the file

## Index Selection

### WIG30 vs WIG20
- **WIG30**: 30 largest and most liquid companies on the Warsaw Stock Exchange
- **WIG20**: Blue-chip index of the 20 largest companies (subset of WIG30)

### How to Switch Between Indices
In `config.py`, change the `ACTIVE_INDEX` constant:
```python
ACTIVE_INDEX = 'WIG20'  # Analyze WIG20 companies
# or
ACTIVE_INDEX = 'WIG30'  # Analyze WIG30 companies (default)
```

## Data Source

**Source**: Yahoo Finance (via yfinance library)
**Data Type**: Quarterly financial statements, balance sheets, and current market data
**Key Metrics**: Net Income, Shareholders' Equity, Current Price, Trailing EPS, ROE, P/E

## Metrics Explained

- **Net Income**: Total profit (or loss) reported in the latest quarter, measured in PLN. A positive net income indicates the company was profitable during that quarter.

- **ROE (Return on Equity)**: Measures how efficiently a company generates profit from shareholders' equity. Calculated as `(Net Income / Shareholders' Equity) × 100%`. Higher ROE indicates better profitability relative to the capital invested by shareholders. For example, ROE of 20% means the company generates 20 PLN of profit for every 100 PLN of equity.

- **P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)**: Measures stock valuation by comparing current stock price to earnings per share (EPS). Formula: P/E = Current Price / Trailing EPS (TTM). Interpretation: Lower P/E suggests the stock may be undervalued. P/E of 10 means you pay 10 PLN for every 1 PLN of annual earnings. Typical value investing threshold: P/E ≤ 15.


- **Profitability**: A company is considered profitable if its net income is positive (> 0). Only profitable companies are included in the analysis.

- **Dual Filtering Strategy**: Combining ROE ≥ 10% (profitability efficiency) with P/E ≤ 15 (reasonable valuation) identifies companies that are both fundamentally strong and potentially undervalued. This is a classic value investing approach.

## Limitations

- **Data Delays**: Financial data is updated quarterly, not in real-time
- **Data Availability**: Some companies may have missing or incomplete financial data
- **ROE Data Availability**: ROE may be unavailable (displayed as "N/A") for some companies if:
  - Balance sheet data is missing from Yahoo Finance
  - Shareholders' equity is zero or negative (can happen for companies with accumulated losses)
  - Data quality issues or reporting delays
- **P/E Ratio Limitations**: P/E may be unavailable for some companies if price or EPS data is missing
  - P/E is not meaningful for unprofitable companies (negative EPS)
  - P/E can be distorted by one-time events affecting earnings
  - Different industries have different "normal" P/E ranges (banks typically have lower P/E than tech companies)
  - The bot uses trailing P/E (based on past 12 months earnings), not forward P/E (based on estimated future earnings)
- **Currency**: Net income is shown in the company's reporting currency
- **Not Investment Advice**: This tool is for informational purposes only and should not be used as investment advice
- **Independent Verification**: Always verify financial data from multiple sources before making decisions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- **Dividend Yield Analysis**: Add dividend yield calculation for income investing strategies
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: Include financial health assessment metrics
- **Price Momentum Indicators**: Add 52-week high/low analysis and momentum indicators
- **Sector-Based Filtering**: Enable filtering and comparison by industry sectors
- **Historical Trend Analysis**: Track ROE and P/E changes over multiple quarters
- **PEG Ratio Calculation**: Add P/E to Growth ratio for growth stock valuation
- **Industry Benchmarking**: Compare company metrics with sector averages and WIG median
- **Forward P/E Analysis**: Include analyst estimates and forward-looking valuations
- **Automated Alerts**: Set up notifications when companies meet filtering criteria
- **Interactive Charts**: Visualize metric distributions using matplotlib or plotly
- **Portfolio Integration**: Import current holdings and analyze against screening criteria
- **Multi-Market Support**: Expand to other European markets or international indices

## Language Note

This bot was developed for analyzing Polish stock market data, but can be easily adapted for other markets by updating the ticker list in the configuration file.
